# Practical Assignment CG - 2020/21

## Documentation

See [docs](https://alef-keuffer.github.io/proj/)

## Goal

The goal of this assignment is to develop a mini scene graph based 3D engine and provide usage
examples that show its potential.

A set of configuration XML files will be used for testing and evaluation
purposes. Each configuration is accompanied by the respective visual output.

### Phase 2

For __phase 2__ the demo scene is a static model of the solar system, including the sun,
planets and moons defined in a hierarchy.

### Phase 3

For __phase 3__ the demo scene is a dynamic solar system, including a comet with a trajectory defined using a
Catmull-Rom curve. The comet must be built using Bezier patches, for instance with the provided
control points for the teapot. 

### Phase 4

For __phase 4__ the demo scene is the animated solar system with texturing and lighting.
